      The UPICAS project is funded by the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR) under the CORE funding scheme, 
        with a total budget of €697,000 (Project Reference: C23/SC/18091359). 
        The project is led by Ziwen Teuber and hosted at the University of Luxembourg, in collaboration with Theresa Dicke from 
        the Australian Catholic University (Sydney, Australia) and Guy Roth from Ben-Gurion University (Be'er Scheva, Israel). 
        UPICAS has received ethical approval from the Ethics Committee of the University of Luxembourg 
        (Protocol Number: ERP ID 24-011 UPICAS) and from Luxembourg's Ministère de l'Education nationale, 
        de l'Enfance et de la Jeunesse. The project collaborates closely with Elerne Forum, SCRIPT, and 
        the Luxembourg Centre for Educational Testing (LUCET).  The project comprises three studies: 
        (a) a parent-adolescent panel study, (b) a parenting coaching study, and (c) a meta-analysis.

    <h2>Panel Study</h2>
      <p>
      The panel study investigates the parental role in children's school and emotional development. 
      Children's challenging achievement situations, such as failing an exam, can be stressful for both the children 
      and their parents. The study aims to identify factors that support parents in maintaining constructive 
      parenting practices in these demanding situations.
      </p>

    <p>
      A total of 41 primary and secondary schools in Luxembourg participated in the three-wave parent-adolescent 
      panel study. Approximately 1,200 students (Learning Cycles 4.1 and 6e classes in Wave 1) and their parents 
      took part. The three waves were conducted in January/February, May/June, and October/November 2025, respectively.
      Moreover, most of our parents have granted us the permission to match their children's ÉpStan data with UPICAS data,
      allowing us to more comprehensively unterstand adolescent development in Luxembourg. Currently, we are finalizing
      the last step of data collection. The preliminary results will be introduced at the DGPS Conference 2026 in Luxembourg.

      <h2>Parenting Coaching Study</h2>
      <p>
        In the parenting coaching study, we implement the "Tuning in to Teens" program and adapt it to the Luxembourgish context. 
        Currently, we are inviting parents of young adolescents (aged 10–14 years) in Luxembourg to participate in this six-week 
        parenting program, which meets once a week for two hours (locations: Bertrange or Belval;languages: English or German). 
        The program is designed to help parents and adolescents navigate the many emotional challenges of this developmental stage. 
        The sessions teach parents how to manage both their own and their adolescent’s emotions in ways that foster closeness and 
        maintain open communication. 
        
        By developing these skills, parents are likely to experience less family conflict, and adolescents are more likely to share 
        the challenges they face. Research indicates that these factors can reduce the risk of mental health issues and substance abuse. 
        The program is grounded in the concept of Emotional Intelligence, which involves using emotions to guide behavior and 
        decision-making. Emotional Intelligence enables individuals to recognize and understand their own emotions, regulate 
        them effectively, manage anger and conflict, navigate social situations, and support healthy interpersonal relationships. 
        These skills help both parents and adolescents handle the complex social and emotional demands of everyday life.
